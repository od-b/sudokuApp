First python project!
Bit wonky and some (most) parts could be simplified.
Design focus was on creating code that would be easy to modify, as well as recycle for differrent apps.
Most magic numbers / constants should be in settings.py

# Todo:
  * Refactor and clean up, especially the menu code. 
  * Refactor to make classes more abstract
  * Reformat settings to json(?)
  * Finish timers.py
